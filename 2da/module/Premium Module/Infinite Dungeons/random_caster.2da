           GREETING                       DESCRIPTION                                                                                                  QUESTION                     HEALING                                                                                              REMAINDER                                  SPELLS                                                                      CAST                                              FAREWELL
0          "Greetings."                   "I can cast spells on you or heal you if you desire. For a price, of course."                                "What would you like?"       "Healing and restoration is free. It is a courtesy I extend to all travellers in these dungeons."    "Is there anything else you desire?"       "I only have a limited number of spells that I can cast."                   "My spells are as good as gold."                  "Maybe later, then."
1          "Welcome, adventurer."         "My wares are spells, and they can cost you dearly."                                                         "What is it you want?"       "Healing is free, spells are not."                                                                   "Anything else I can do for you?"          "My stock of spells is somewhat limited, but powerful."                     "Through my magic, I serve my customers well."    "Farewell."
2          "I knew you would come."       "Magic is my trade, and all my customers have been satisfied."                                               "Have something in mind?"    "If you're satisfied with this healing, why not try some of my other spells as well?"                "What else do you want?"                   "The spells I have to offer should meet all your needs."                    "Magic, heed my call!"                            "You will return. I can feel it."
3          "I predicted your arrival."    "I can use my arts to assist you, but the power will cost a fair price."                                     "What is your desire?"       "Of course. No cost for the healing, but I do hope you will try some of my other spells."            "There must be more that interests you."   "I hope you appreciate the scope of my offerings. Few have such power."     "Feel the power coursing around us!"              "Until next time..."
4          "Finally, you arrive!"         "I can see the burning desire for power, hidden in your heart. I can help with that, if you have the coin."  "What can I offer you?"      "It wouldn't do to have a customer fall apart after I cast a spell on them. No charge for this."     "What else can I do for you?"              "There are so many to choose from. I expect you will be pleased."           "It shall be done!"                               "I will be here, should you need me."
5          "Come, sit and talk to me."    "I have prepared a large assortment of spells for you, should you have the interest and the gold."           "Tell me what tempts you."   "There is so much more I can offer you, but beyond healing it all costs. It is worth it, though."    "You want more power, right?"              "Let us see what forces of magic interest you the most, shall we?"          "Powers of the cosmos, do my bidding!"            "I wait upon your pleasure."
