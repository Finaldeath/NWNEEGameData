0          "Oh, gods!"                            "Finally, someone who can help me... you will help me, right?"                            "I shouldn't be telling you this, but my name is"                        "I hope you can accept"                           "important"           "Would you be able to help me?"                            "Blessed news!"                              "Good luck."                                 "Oh, gods! This is terrible!"                                 "You… you're back! I hope this means something good."                         "Oh, thank the gods! I was really worried for a while."      "Oh, gods, I'm going to die, aren't I?! You must be successful!"
1          "Don't hurt me!"                       "I… I have a favor to ask. Would you be willing to help me out with something?"           "Don't go spreading this around, but my name is"                         "I know your time is valuable, worth at least"    "significant"         "You can help me, right?"                                  "Joy!"                                       "Be safe."                                   "Oh, dear. Whatever shall I do?"                              "Oh, I thought you might have died already."                                  "You mean I'm saved? Oh, thank you!"                         "This is horrible news. Please, there is little time!"
2          "Please, no!"                          "You look like you're tough enough to survive down here. Could you help me out?"          "Since you haven't hurt me yet, you can call me"                         "I'll pay you all I have;"                        "considerable"        "Oh, please tell me you will do this."                     "Saved!"                                     "Bye."                                       "Leave me here to suffer, then!"                              "You! Oh, thank the gods you live!"                                           "Really? I thought for sure you'd just abandon me here!"     "I have never felt such a shiver of fear from such a simple statement."
3          "Oh! You scared me!"                   "Maybe you are braver than I am. I have something that needs to be done."                 "People are less likely to hurt you when they know your name. Mine is"   "You can have everything, say"                    "critical"            "Will you help me with this?"                              "Thank you!"                                 "Goodbye."                                   "You're no better than the others I've asked!"                "How pleased I am to see you!"                                                "Praise be! You don't know how much this means."             "I… I can't take much more of this waiting."
4          "Why are you accosting me?"            "You look so… so… experienced. Maybe you could help me?"                                  "I should tell you that I'm known as"                                    "Don't be upset, but all I can afford is"         "meaningful"          "It would mean so much if you could help me."              "What a relief!"                             "May the gods protect you."                  "But… but… I'm doomed, then!"                                 "You're back. I hope you're not back to hurt me."                             "You are? I mean… you are! Excellent!"                       "I can feel the judging stare of Kelemvor already."
5          "Are you a hero?"                      "I'm so afraid of what might happen if I can't find someone to help me."                  "If it will relax you, I'll tell you my name is"                         "I would give you more, but all I have is"        "momentous"           "I hope I haven't offended you. You can help, right?"      "I was really worried for a moment."         "Don't get hurt."                            "I wish I could say I was surprised. No one will help me."    "I'm a little jumpy right now, but it is good to see you again."              "You… you aren't serious, are you? Oh, you are!"             "Why must my luck be so bad? Does Tymora hate me?"
6          "Luck is with me!"                     "It's a horror, I tell you! A horror! I really need your help."                           "I was receiving death threats, so I changed my name to"                 "I hope you can do this for"                      "notable"             "I fear I ask to much, but you can help me, can't you?"    "I could just hug you! But I won't!"         "Be brave!"                                  "Then go! Just go! No one cares what happens to me!"          "You're not hurt are you? You should rest, if you are hurt."                  "No! Really? Oh, thank the gods!"                            "Am I doomed, then? You mustn't give up!"
7          "Help me!"                             "Assistance is needed, right away, or I'm doomed!"                                        "I always seem to get into trouble when I tell people that my name is"   "I… I can pay you"                                "noteworthy"          "It would be a real relief if you could help me."          "I feel much better now, thank you."         "Oh, I have a bad feeling about this."       "I knew it! I'm dead! Gah!"                                   "Oh! I thought you were an evil doppelganger of yourself, come to kill me."   "Oh… I wish I could have been there to help you."            "Heart… racing… blood… gushing… must not panic!"
8          "Aaah! Oh, you're no monster."         "You've got to help me out. I'm in quite a quandary."                                     "Have you heard of me? Probably not. My name's"                          "If you can do this, I'll give you"               "substantial"         "You think you can possibly help me with this?"            "I'm so glad you came along."                "Don't die, please!"                         "Rats! Rats, rats, rats! Leave me alone!"                     "I… I am ready for the news, good or bad. Well, hopefully good."              "Now I feel like such a coward for not helping you."         "Couldn't you have lied, just a little? Never mind, it's just the fear of death talking."
9          "I hope this isn't going to be bad."   "Gods be praised if you're here to help me! I certainly need it."                         "It used to be a much easier place to live. Oh, you can call me"         "The trouble is, I can only afford to pay"        "valuable"            "Dear gods, please tell me you will do this!"              "Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you!"       "This is going to end badly. Bye."           "Just leave me alone, then!"                                  "I just about fainted when you came back."                                    "That was such a close one. I thought I was dead!"           "Curse this dungeon! Am I never to be free of this horror? You must hurry!"
