0          "Greetings, stranger."             "I am so glad you stopped to speak with me."                                            "My name is"                                               "I would love to pay you"                       "valuable"            "You'll do that, right?"                                             "Excellent!"                      "Goodbye, then!"                                "That is unfortunate. Return if you change your mind."                  "Welcome back, friend."                              "I knew you could do it!"                                        "Well, I'm sure you'll be done in no time."
1          "Welcome, friend."                 "There was a dark moment when I thought you were going to kill me."                     "You may call me"                                          "It would be an honor to offer you"             "appreciated"         "You can do that, can't you?"                                        "Wonderful!"                      "Goodbye, friend!"                              "I had hoped for better. Leave me, please."                             "I see you have returned, my ally."                  "I knew I could count on you!"                                   "I trust it will not take you too much longer, friend."
2          "Salutations!"                     "I saw you coming in here and I thought to myself, 'Now here's the one I need.'"        "Allow me to introduce myself, I'm"                        "I can afford to pay you"                       "cherished"           "That should take you no time at all. Right?"                        "Fabulous!"                       "Best of luck!"                                 "Leave me alone, then."                                                 "Tell me, friend, why have you returned?"            "Yes! Nobody thought you could do it, but I did!"                "I'm sure you are on a tight schedule, so I won't keep you."
3          "Hail, friend."                    "It is a pleasure to meet such a fine personage as yourself."                           "It would please me if you would call me"                  "For your efforts, you can have"                "helpful"             "You could help a friend out, can't you?"                            "Incredible!"                     "May the gods protect you!"                     "I need some time to think about this. Goodbye."                        "I greet your return, my helper."                    "Excellent! You're a good friend!"                               "Perseverance, my friend. Keep going!"
4          "My compliments on your outfit."   "I hope you have some time to listen to a request."                                     "All my friends call me"                                   "I'll give you"                                 "precious"            "I'd take it as a personal favor if you could do that. All right?"   "Glad to have you on my side!"    "Many blessings on you, comrade!"               "I hope you will change your mind before it is too late."               "You have returned, friend."                         "I am so pleased to hear it. I was really counting on you."      "With no end in sight, all we can do is try."
5          "How are you?"                     "Allow me a second to breath a sigh of relief… there, that is better."                  "Let me tell you my name, it's"                            "I think this is worth at least"                "prized"              "I'm certain you could handle that little task, right?"              "Good enough, then!"              "May your paths be safe."                       "I guess I will have to find someone else, then."                       "You came back, comrade!"                            "What a triumph, my friend!"                                     "I like your honesty and I always enjoy our visits."
6          "Nice to meet you."                "I was worried about who would come to such a place, but you are a welcome sight."      "I think I can trust you enough to tell you I'm called"    "I am willing to part with"                     "treasured"           "Is that something you could do for a pal?"                          "That's what I like to hear!"     "Stay well, my friend."                         "You hurt me, friend. I thought I might be able to count on you."       "It is good to see you again, my ally."              "What is this? Excellent work, friend!"                          "I will just have to keep waiting, then, won't I?"
7          "Pleasure to meet you."            "You have a look about your face that says, 'trust me,' and I sure hope it's real."     "I do enjoy meeting new people. I'm"                       "Your time is worth a lot. Let's say"           "inestimable"         "I just know you can do this, right?"                                "What great news!"                "Farewell, my ally."                            "That is sad to hear. I'd better rethink my plans, then. Good luck."    "Welcome, friend. I am pleased to see you again."    "You have exceeded my expectations. Good job!"                   "I will try to be patient. It is difficult, sometimes."
8          "Tymora's luck!"                   "There have been dozens of adventurers through here before, but you seem special."      "Just call me"                                             "I wish I could pay even more, but I offer"     "considerable"        "A skilled adventurer like you can do that, right?"                  "Fantastic!"                      "Godspeed to you, friend."                      "Then I shall need to find another, if that is possible. Goodbye."      "Hello again, my helper."                            "And won't we just be singing praises of you for years!"         "I am certain you just wanted to assure me you were still on the job."
9          "I see you, friend."               "I have had a terrible time, but things seem to be improving now that you are here."    "I hope you will call me"                                  "I'd say this is worth about"                   "significant"         "Are you up to handling that, my friend?"                            "Terrific!"                       "Take care of yourself, my newfound friend."    "I'll try not to take that personally. You stay safe out there."        "Good to see you yet live, comrade."                 "My friend! Well done, well done indeed!"                        "Very well, hopefully you are making some progress."
