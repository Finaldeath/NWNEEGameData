           GREETING                       ASKING                                                PURCHASE                                                   POOR                                                                     BOUGHT                                                                              GOODBYE
0          "Greetings."                   "Would you like to buy some useful creatures?"        "How many were you thinking?"                              "You don't seem to have enough gold to buy any, though."                 "Great! If there's anything else I can do for you, don't hesitate to come back."    "Good luck, adventurer."
1          "Hail, traveller."             "Will you be wanting any pets?"                       "How many do you want to buy?"                             "You can't buy what you don't have gold for."                            "If you want more of my stock, you know where to find me."                          "Pleasant journeys."
2          "Another adventurer, eh?"      "Can't say no to a deal like this, can you?"          "I know you want some, so how many is it?"                 "I don't give them away for free. You'll have to have money."            "Remember: If they break, there's no returns."                                      "We'll see more of each other, I think."
3          "Welcome to my humble shop."   "How about I make you an offer you can't refuse?"     "You are welcome to as many as we can supply."             "Maybe you should go earn some gold or sell some treasure first."        "Treat them well and they will last you a lifetime. A short lifetime."              "Try not to get killed out there."
4          "A prospective customer!"      "This is the next big thing on the market. You in?"   "We have a few in stock. How many you need?"               "Perhaps another time, when you have some gold on you."                  "If you have any questions, don't look at me. I just sell them."                    "Farewell, stranger."
5          "Well, hello there."           "How would you like to make the deal of a life time?" "We sell them as fast as we can catch them. How many?"     "Great another customer with more desire than gold. Get lost."           "Satisfaction guaranteed... well, not really, but I hope you like them."            "Take care of your new friends."
