0         "Hold, mortal!"                     "Before you go any further, I have a proposition for you."                                "If you need a name, call me"                                  "I suppose I could even pay you"                             "minor"               "You think you can handle such a difficult task?"                "Well… good."                                "Try not to die too quickly."                           "Typical. Get lost."                                                             "You have more strength than I expected."                           "About bloody time! Not that I'm not glad it's done."                                 "What do you think you're doing? Taking a holiday?"
1         "What do you want?"                 "Since you seem to have an ounce of talent, let me tell you about a job."                 "I hate to reveal anything about myself, but you may call me"  "Since you're doing this for me, I could pay "               "insignificant"       "Are you up for this, or not?"                                   "All right, then."                           "Don't get lost."                                       "Take your stench out of here, then."                                            "Not dead yet? What a shock."                                       "I never expected you to survive. Glad I was wrong."                                  "And so you just returned to annoy me a little more?"
2         "Pay attention, maggot!"            "I hate to bring myself down to your level, but I have need for someone like you."        "The name is"                                                  "Not that you'll likely survive, but if you do this,"        "dinky"               "I know this probably terrifies you, but you up to it?"          "It is agreed."                              "Don't go getting yourself killed."                     "Go soak your head in a lava pool, then."                                        "And here I thought I might never see you again."                   "Worth having to stomach the stench of you, then!"                                    "You remind me of someone… stupid."
3         "Bloody hells!"                     "I have an offer and you'll be taking it, if you've an ounce of courage or brains."       "If you must, you can call me"                                 "I guess your wasted efforts are worth"                      "inconsequential"     "I suspect this is too difficult for you, but you want to try?"  "The deal is made."                          "Like I'll ever see you again."                         "Leave here, then!"                                                              "I am pleased to see you again, but a little sad you yet live."     "Well, there's something new and shocking everyday!"                                  "Then get back out there and show some spine!"
4         "Why are you accosting me?"         "If we're going to get along, then you must be willing to help me out with something."    "Use my name respectfully. It's"                               "Should you manage not to bungle things,"                    "inconsiderable"      "Much as it grates, I must ask for your help. All right?"        "Hmm… surprising."                           "Don't get crushed to a bloody pulp."                   "If your simple brain realizes what a great deal I offered, return to me."       "How unusual. You came back."                                       "And now you've come to grab your prize, of course!"                                  "What the hells is taking you so long?"
5         "If it isn't a fancy adventurer."   "Life is so complicated in this dungeon. How about you help me with something?"           "I have many names, but you will have to know me as"           "Not that you deserve so much, but I'm offering"             "inferior"            "This leaves a bad taste in my mouth, but will you help me?"     "Better than I expected."                    "Try not to tell anyone you're associated with me."     "Bah! I've met rocks smarter than you."                                          "Alive and well? You had better be."                                "Really? Well, I'll be a buttered monkey!"                                            "It's not complex magic, for Halaster's sake. Just do the job."
6         "Who the hells are you?"            "How would you like to make yourself useful and help me out with something?"              "Not that I should grace you with my name, but call me"        "I'd rather crush your skull, but since I need this done,"   "negligible"          "What do you think? Interested?"                                 "Then we have a deal."                       "Don't embarrass me out there."                         "Get out of my way, then."                                                       "I hope you aren't a coward, fleeing from my quest."                "Is that so? Well, good enough, then."                                                "Hurry it up, then. Sloth is a great weakness."
7         "Well, you smell bloody awful."     "Since you obviously enjoy nosing about other people's business, I have a job for you."   "I won't draw this out. Call me"                               "Try not to upset me and I might pay you"                    "paltry"              "I'm not asking for the world here. You up for the challenge?"   "I should get that in writing. Never mind."  "If you get killed, don't come crying to me."           "Blasted fool! Leave here!"                                                      "You again? This had better be good."                               "I'd try to bicker on the price, but that would mean spending more time with you."    "And yet you drag the stench of your body back here. Lovely!"
8         "Stop gaping at me!"                "You look like you might have some skills. How about we work a deal here?"                "You had better show me some respect. Call me"                 "Your feeble efforts could earn you"                         "petty"               "I don't suppose you can handle a job this big, can you?"        "Right. I'll believe it when I see it."      "Be quick. I get bored easily."                         "Like I was expecting any different, coward. Flee here, then!"                   "About time you got back here."                                     "And I should be all shocked and impressed, huh?"                                     "I am patient, yet… no, wait, I'm not patient at all. Hurry it up!"
9         "What are you looking at?"          "How would you like to earn a little gold for blundering about like a drunken ox?"        "Before we go any further, you can call me"                    "As undeserving as you might be, you'll get"                 "piddling"            "So, you got the stomach for this job?"                          "You'd better."                              "Now take your stench and get out of here."             "You would probably have failed anyway. Probably for the best."                  "How hard is this? I gave you a simple little quest. You done?"     "Took you long enough!"                                                               "What exactly are you waiting for?
