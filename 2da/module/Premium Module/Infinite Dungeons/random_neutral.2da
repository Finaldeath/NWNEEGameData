0          "Hello there."                     "Stay a while and listen."                                                              "You can call me"                                          "I can afford to pay you"                       "great"               "Do you think you can handle that?"            "Good."                            "Good luck."                        "Then I will say goodbye."                            "You have returned."                   "Ah, good news at last!"                                         "I shall try to be patient, then."
1          "Who's there?"                     "You seem like a competent adventurer, I have an offer to make."                        "Let's try to get along. You can call me"                  "For your efforts, I think"                     "abundant"            "Can you do that?"                             "Done."                            "Stay well."                        "I feared you might feel that way. Goodbye, then."    "You came back."                       "I was hoping to hear something like that today."                "Let us hope this will not take too much longer."
2          "Excuse me?"                       "I have a proposition that I think might interest you."                                 "My name is"                                               "I'll willingly give you"                       "enormous"            "Want to help me out?"                         "Fine, then."                      "Don't get trampled out there."     "Then keep moving, stranger."                         "At least you are still alive."        "Very good! I choose wisely in trusting you."                    "I await your triumphant return. I wait and I wait."
3          "I see you."                       "I am trusting that you are better prepared than the last adventurer."                  "I suppose a name would help here. Call me"                "I think this is worth"                         "extensive"           "You can help me out, right?"                  "Good to hear it."                 "Goodbye."                          "Leave me, then. I have other things to do."          "Greetings."                           "And I thought this would be a real challenge for you."          "Do not be long. This is an important quest."
4          "I acknowledge your presence."     "You look like one who might survive a challenge."                                      "Just call me"                                             "This is worth about"                           "extreme"             "Can you do me this favor?"                    "Good enough."                     "Bye."                              "I'm beginning to hate this place. Bye."              "Good to see you again."               "Excellent. Today is a good day indeed."                         "Then why return here? Get back out there."
5          "How is it going?"                 "You almost had me thinking you were an enemy."                                         "I am often referred to as"                                "I am able to pay"                              "gigantic"            "Can you handle this task?"                    "Very well."                       "Farewell."                         "Whatever. Your loss."                                "Hello again."                         "Good. I could find no one else capable."                        "I hate waiting. "
6          "How goes it?"                     "Do you have time to entertain an offer of employment?"                                 "If you need a name, you can call me"                      "For this job, let's say"                       "huge"                "You can do this, right?"                      "I am pleased to hear it."         "Godspeed."                         "Now I have to find someone else to help. Blast!"     "Welcome back."                        "You have my thanks, then."                                      "At least you aren't dead."
7          "Good day."                        "I have an opportunity I would like to share with you."                                 "This is a good time for introductions. Call me"           "The best I can offer you is"                   "immense"             "You think you're up to the task?"             "I was hoping you would agree."    "Stay calm out there."              "Thanks for nothing."                                 "I see you return to me."              "Well, I wasn't expecting you to be so quick."                   "Keep trying then, please."
8          "Welcome."                         "I have heard some exciting things about you, perking my interest."                     "I always wanted to be called"                             "Let me see. I could go as high as"             "prolonged"           "That should take you little time, right?"     "Onwards, then."                   "Hope to see you again soon."       "Return if you change your mind."                     "Back again. Good."                    "That took a while, but I'm glad it is done."                    "Time marches on and waits for no one."
9          "You look tough enough."           "Interested in a job? Of course you are! Let me tell you about one."                    "It would be easiest if you would refer to me as"          "I think I could pay you"                       "protracted"          "Are you up to the challenge?"                 "Done deal."                       "May our paths cross again."        "And that's the kind of day I'm having!"              "You are back and still alive."        "Worth every gold piece, I do hope."                             "Good thing I wasn't holding my breath."
